Welcome to my test website! 

## About me

I'm a computer science student. 

## I also love memes!

Below is a meme I made using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).

A really short and unhelpful summary of my inspiration for the meme is:

1. I found a meme I liked
2. I copied it, but used cats

I also probably should provide the `R` code I used to make the meme!
